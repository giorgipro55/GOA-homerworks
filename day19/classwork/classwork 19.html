<p style="color: rgba(36, 228, 10, 0.87);">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and CSS.Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. <br>
Web browsers have a dedicatedJavaScript engine that executes the client code. <br>
These engines are also utilized in some servers and a varietyof apps.The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, <br>
prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, <br>
supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) 
for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). <br>
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice,
the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. <br> 
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.History <br>
Creation at Netscape
The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. <br>Accessible to non-technical people, it played a
prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation,
which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used. <br>
During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was <br>
loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to
add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java <br>
language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language. <br>
The goal was a "language for the masses", "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites". <br>[15] Netscape management soon
decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting 
languages.Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of <br> a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.
The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. <br> At the time, the dot-com boom had begun
and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.</p>
